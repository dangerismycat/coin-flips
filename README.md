# How many flips of *n* times does it take to get all heads?

This program will perform sets of *n* coin flips until it gets a set of all "heads" (or tails, whatever â€” just flips that are all the same) and return the count taken to get there. Great for satisfying inane curiousity, or just chewing through a whole bunch of extra CPU cycles. What fun!

Tweak the variable at the top of the file to adjust *n*. Run on command line with `node index`.
